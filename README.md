This is a personal portfolio website showcasing my professional background and skills. The website features a clean, responsive design with bilingual support (Portuguese and English).

## Technologies Used

- **External Resources**: Integrated Font Awesome icons for social media links and external stylesheets

### CSS3
- **Flexbox Layout**: Utilized CSS Flexbox for creating flexible and responsive layouts, particularly for the main content wrapper and contact panel
